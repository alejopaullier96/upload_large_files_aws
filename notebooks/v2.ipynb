    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version we have an API endpoint which is integrated with a Lambda function that gets a pre-signed URL for an S3 bucket. The pre-signed URL is returned to the client who uploads a file (in this case an image) to the corresponding S3 bucket. To do this CORS is configured in the bucket so the client is allowed to upload the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "After uploading the image, and EventNotification triggers a second Lambda function that is in charge of pre-processing the image and later store it in a different S3 bucket. The first S3 bucket contains \"raw\" data, while the second is for pre-processed images. In order for the pre-processing Lambda to `PUT` objects inside the bucket we need to configure:\n",
    "1. The Lambda's layers: we must add the necessary Lambda layers required to perform our business logic.\n",
    "2. The Lambda's role policy: we must add the necessary permissions so that the Lambda function can `PUT` objects inside the pre-processing bucket.\n",

    "### Add object metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to add object metadata when we request the pre-signed URL. We need this because downstream the object will be stored inside the client's designated folder in S3.

    "### Allow client to pass user metadata \n",
    "\n",
    "To allow the client to pass his metadata we need to change our HTTP method that invokes the `get_signed_url` function from a `GET` to a `POST` since `GET` methods are not able to pass a `body` with data.\n",
